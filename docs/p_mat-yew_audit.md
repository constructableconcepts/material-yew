# Mat-Yew Post-Audit Refactoring
v.1.0.0

## 1. Objective

To execute the comprehensive refactoring and enhancement plan detailed in the **`docs/mat-yew_development_plan.md`**. This initiative is the direct result of the systemic findings from **Feature Audit `B`** (`docs/feature_audit_b.md`) and aims to elevate the `material-yew` library to a production-ready state.

## 2. Current Status: Stable

The project is currently in a **stable state**. The critical rendering failure that previously blocked development has been resolved. All components now render correctly, and the `matdemo` application is fully functional.

The development team is now proceeding with the tasks outlined in the **`docs/audit_b_checklist.md`**.

## 3. Background

The project has undergone two major audits:
- **Feature Audit `A`**: Focused on initial component implementation and API design.
- **Feature Audit `B`**: A more in-depth, systemic review that identified architectural patterns needing improvement, leading to the current development plan.

The successful completion of the initial phase of the Audit `B` refactoring has resolved all known stability issues.

## 4. Next Steps

Continue executing the tasks in the **`docs/audit_b_checklist.md`**. Each task should be treated as a separate unit of work, with its own branch, pull request, and verification.
