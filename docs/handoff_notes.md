# Handoff Notes: `matdemo` Silent Rendering Failure

v.1.0.0

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this session was to debug and resolve a silent client-side rendering failure in the `matdemo` application. The failure manifested as a blank page with no console errors.

## 2. Summary of Work

A "divide and conquer" strategy was employed to isolate the faulty component. This process successfully narrowed down the source of the failure to the `Tabs` component located in `src/tabs.rs`.

Multiple hypotheses for the root cause were formulated and tested, but none have resolved the issue. The session concludes with the bug still present.

## 3. Attempted Fixes & Outcomes

### 3.1. Hypothesis 1: Incorrect Prop Type in `Tab` Component (FAILED)

-   **Theory:** The `children` prop in the `Tab` component was of type `Html`, while similar working components used `Children`. This inconsistency was suspected to be the cause.
-   **Action:**
    1.  Modified `src/tab.rs` to change the `children` prop to `Children`.
    2.  Updated the rendering logic in `src/tab.rs` to iterate over the `Children` collection.
-   **Result:** The final verification test failed. The application still did not render. This hypothesis was proven incorrect.

### 3.2. Hypothesis 2: Misplaced JavaScript Import (FAILED)

-   **Theory:** The JavaScript module for the `<md-tabs>` web component was being imported in the child `Tab` component (`src/tab.rs`) instead of the parent `Tabs` component (`src/tabs.rs`) where the element is used.
-   **Action:**
    1.  Removed the JS import from `src/tab.rs`.
    2.  Added the JS import to `src/tabs.rs`.
-   **Result:** The final verification test failed. This hypothesis was proven incorrect.

### 3.3. Hypothesis 3: Superfluous `Clone` Trait on `Tabs` Props (FAILED)

-   **Theory:** The `Props` struct for the `Tabs` component derived the `Clone` trait, which was not present on other working components like `List`. This was suspected of causing an issue with Yew's rendering process.
-   **Action:**
    1.  Removed the `Clone` trait from the `derive` macro in `src/tabs.rs`.
-   **Result:** The final verification test failed. This hypothesis was proven incorrect.

### 3.4. Hypothesis 4: Problematic `active-index` Attribute (FAILED)

-   **Theory:** The `active-index` attribute on the `<md-tabs>` web component was causing a silent failure, possibly due to a bug in the underlying component when no children are present.
-   **Action:**
    1.  Temporarily removed the `active-index` attribute from the `<md-tabs>` element in `src/tabs.rs`.
    2.  In a subsequent attempt, removed the `active_index` field from the `Props` struct entirely.
-   **Result:** Both tests failed. The application still did not render, proving this hypothesis incorrect.

## 4. Current Status

-   The bug is definitively located within the `Tabs` component (`src/tabs.rs`).
-   The component fails to render even when it has no children.
-   Multiple targeted fixes have been attempted and have failed, indicating a more subtle, fundamental issue.
-   All attempted changes to the codebase have been reverted, and the code is in its original state at the beginning of the session.
