# Mat-Yew Library Systemic Development Plan
v.0.0.3

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the systemic development plan for the `material-yew` library. It is the primary tracking and planning document for the project, superseding any previous, narrower plans. Its purpose is to guide the library to a state of production-readiness by addressing architectural, API, and documentation issues systematically.

## 2. Background: Audits

This development plan is the direct result of two comprehensive audits:
- **Feature Audit `A` (`docs/feature_audit_a.md`):** An initial review of the library's components and features against the Material Design 3 specification and the `material-web` reference implementation. This audit identified foundational gaps in component APIs and features.
- **Feature Audit `B` (`docs/feature_audit_b.md`):** A deeper, more systemic audit that focused on the developer experience (DX), API ergonomics, and architectural patterns. This audit revealed the need for a comprehensive, library-wide refactoring to ensure consistency, robustness, and maintainability.

The findings of these audits directly inform the phases and tasks outlined below.

## 3. Core Objective

To execute the findings of the audits by refactoring and enhancing the `material-yew` library to achieve full feature parity with the `material-web` reference implementation, establish robust and ergonomic developer APIs, and produce comprehensive documentation.

## 4. Development Phases & Checklists

The work is broken down into a series of checklists corresponding to the audits.

- **Audit A Checklist (`docs/audit_a_checklist.md`):** Completed.
- **Audit B Checklist (`docs/audit_b_checklist.md`):** In Progress.
